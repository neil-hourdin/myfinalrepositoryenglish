          <p>Few words about me... <br>

          <br>

          Currently studying first year of business school, I have enjoyed for several years observing, understanding and analyzing the world around us, from atom to geopolitics.br> Enjoying playing with numbers as well as with letters and words, I am motivated to become the CFO of a large CAC40 company that I find particularly rewarding for its plurality of players and challenges that these companies invite its employees to think about.<br>

          It is very important for me to never stop opening up and always be attentive to what the world has to offer.<br>

          I am deeply convinced that success and success are the result of constant motivation, positive thinking and unwavering curiosity.</p>
